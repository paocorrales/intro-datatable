### Who are you?

Share your name and what's your favourite ice-cream flavour.

## Housekeeping

You will need:

-   R
-   data.table

``` r
install.packages("data.table")
```

-   ggplot2 or any other visualisation package (optional)

## What is data.table?

At its core, data.table provides an enhanced version of data.frames that are faster, more memory efficient and can be manipulated using a more concise syntax.

It also provides a whole set of extra functions for reading from and writing to tabular files, reshaping data between long and wide formats, joining datasets and much more.

## Why data.table?

-   Fast and efficient
-   Does not have dependencies
-   Syntax is very concise
-   Ensures backwards compatibility

## Follow along

If you can, try the code we will show you on the screen.

If you're stuck or need help, tell us in the chat.

### Materials

<https://paocorrales.github.io/intro-datatable/>

## The syntax

The general data.table syntax looks like this:

```{=html}
<div  style=" margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block; text-align:center; width:fit-content;"> 
<p style="font-size:200%;font-weight:bold" >
<code>DT[<span class="rows">i</span>, <span class="columns">j</span>, <span class="by">by</span>]</code>
</p>
</div>
```

Where <code>**DT**</code> is a data.table object, the <code class="rows">[**i**]{.rows}</code> argument is used for filtering and joining operations, the <code class="columns">[**j**]{.columns}</code> argument can summarise and transform, and the <code class="by">[**by**]{.by}</code> argument defines the groups to which to apply these operations.

You can read the syntax as "In these rows, do this, grouped by that".

It is very concise but easy to read (sometimes).

## Reference semantics

Most R functions and methods uses **copy-on-modify**.

This code returns a new tibble that is a copy of `my_data` with a new column but it doesn't modify `my_data`.

``` r
my_data |> 
  mutate(new_column = old_column*2)
```
. . .

data.table uses **modify-in-place**, which means that objects are **not** copied when modified.
This code doesn't create a new copy of `my_data` but it rather modifies `my_data` directly.

``` r
my_data[, new_column := old_column*2]
```
. . .

This is similar to the base R code:

``` r
my_data$new_column <- data$new_column
```

### Exercises

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Filter some rows

1.  Is your favourite band/artist listed in the data (column `sort_name` or `clean_name`)?

```{r}
rolling_stone[clean_name == "ABBA"]
```

2.  Who are the "30 under 30" in 2020? That is, bands with an average age under 30 years (column `ave_age_at_top_500`) that are in the top 30 in 2020 (`rank_2020`).

```{r}
rolling_stone[ave_age_at_top_500 < 30 & rank_2020 < 30] 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Work with columns

1.  Are more popular albums on Spotify (column `spotify_popularity`) higher in the 2003 ranking (column `rank_2003`)? Compute the correlation between the two columns (hint: there are missing values, so you will need to use `use = "complete.obs"`).

```{r}
rolling_stone[, cor(spotify_popularity, rank_2003, use = "complete.obs")]
```

2.  Which rankings are missing in the database?

```{r}
rolling_stone[, which(!(1:500 %in% rank_2003))]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Operate over colums and groups

1.  How may bands in the Latin genre (column `genre`) appeared in the raking of 2020?

```{r, solution=TRUE}
rolling_stone[genre == "latin", sum(!is.na(rank_2020))]
```

2.  How many male, female or mixed-gender (column `artist_gender`) bands were included in the 2020 ranking (column `rank_2020`)?

```{r, solution=TRUE}
rolling_stone[, sum(!is.na(rank_2020)), by = artist_gender]
```

3.  Add a column with the average of the birth year of each band (columns `artist_birth_year_sum` and `artist_member_count` are relevant)?

```{r, solution=TRUE}
rolling_stone[, artist_birth_year_mean := artist_birth_year_sum/artist_member_count]
```

4.  Add a column with the average ranking of each album (columns `rank_2003`, `rank_2012` and `rank_2020` and `album_id`).

```{r, solution=TRUE}
rolling_stone[, mean_raking := mean(c(rank_2003, rank_2012, rank_2020), na.rm = TRUE), by = album_id]
```

# Break!

Take 15 minutes.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 15,  
                     color_text = "#008080", 
                     color_running_background = "#008080",  
                     color_running_text = "white")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Piping operations

1.  Are bands (artists with `artist_member_count` greater than 1) more successful than solo artists?

```{r, solution=TRUE}

rolling_stone[, is_band := artist_member_count > 1] |>
  _[, .(mean_rank_2003 = mean(rank_2003, na.rm = TRUE),
        mean_rank_2012 = mean(rank_2012, na.rm = TRUE),
        mean_rank_2020 = mean(rank_2020, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    by = is_band]

# Notice that due to reference semantics, this operation adds the 
# is_band column to the data.table. You can avoid this by using 
# an expression in the by argument.
rolling_stone |> 
  _[, .(mean_rank_2003 = mean(rank_2003, na.rm = TRUE),
        mean_rank_2012 = mean(rank_2012, na.rm = TRUE),
        mean_rank_2020 = mean(rank_2020, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    by = .(is_band = artist_member_count > 1)]

```

2.  What is the proportion of albums recorded in a Studio and their mean position in 2020?

```{r, solution=TRUE}
rolling_stone[, .(mean_rank_2020 = mean(rank_2020, na.rm = TRUE),
                  N = sum(!is.na(rank_2020))), by = type] |> 
  _[, prop := N/sum(N)]

```

3.  What is the mean number of years between an artist debut album and the release of their first top 500 album (see the column `years_between`) for each genre?

```{r, solution=TRUE}
rolling_stone[, .(mean_years = mean(years_between, na.rm = TRUE), .N),
                by = genre] |> 
  _[order(mean_years)]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Let's melt the data

1.  What is the mean rank on each ranking year for gender?

    ```{r}
    rolling_stone |> 
      melt(id.vars = c("release_year", "album_id", "artist_gender"), 
           measure.vars = c("rank_2003", "rank_2012", "rank_2020"), 
           variable.name = "rank_year",
           value.name = "rank") |> 
      _[, .(mean_rank = mean(rank, na.rm = TRUE)), 
        by = .(rank_year, artist_gender)]
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Reshape!

1.  What is the proportion of Male to Female artists for each decade in the 2003 ranking?

    ```{r}
    rolling_stone |> 
      _[, .(N = sum(!is.na(rank_2003))), 
        by = .(decade = floor(release_year / 10) * 10, artist_gender)] |> 
      dcast(decade ~ artist_gender, value.var = "N") |> 
      setnafill(fill = 0) |> 
      _[, ratio := Male / (Male + Female)] |> 
      ggplot(aes(decade, ratio)) +
      geom_line()
    ```

2.  Has this changed between the different ranking years?
    (You need to first melt and then dcast)

    ```{r}
    rolling_stone |> 
      melt(id.vars = c("release_year", "album_id", "artist_gender"), 
           measure.vars = c("rank_2003", "rank_2012", "rank_2020"), 
           variable.name = "rank_year",
           value.name = "rank") |> 
      _[, .(N = sum(!is.na(rank))),
        by = .(decade = floor(release_year / 10) * 10, artist_gender, rank_year)] |> 
      dcast(decade + rank_year ~ artist_gender, value.var = "N") |> 
      _[, ratio := Male / (Male + Female)] |> 
      ggplot(aes(decade, ratio)) +
      geom_line(aes(color = rank_year))

    ```
