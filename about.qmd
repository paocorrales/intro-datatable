<a href="https://r-datatable.com"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdatatable/data.table/master/.graphics/logo.png" align="right" height="140" /></a>

At its core, data.table provides an enhanced version of data.frames that are faster, more memory efficient and can be manipulated using a more concise syntax.
It also provides a whole set of extra functions for reading from and writing to tabular files, reshaping data between long and wide formats, joining data sets and much more.

data.table mascot is a sea lion, which barks "R R R" 

Take a quick look at it funtionalities:

It is a great time to join the data.table community! In 2023-2025, National Science Foundation has provided funds to support expanding the ecosystem of users and contributors around data.table. You can start checking:


* The Raft [rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft](https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/), the data.table blog.
Sea lions often float together on the ocean's surface in groups called "rafts".
* The GitHub [repo](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) with 900+ open issues, 100+ open PRs. 
If you have any time/interest, we could use your help!
